# DevOps Resources

Any readings or useful notes I take whilst researching and developing my own devops skills I will try to note here.

This repo is intended for personal use but if you stumble across this and are looking for resources to learn devops there may be some resources here that will help. I would recommend starting with the following:
- What is DevOps: https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/
- What is a container: https://youtu.be/EnJ7qX9fkcU
- Kubernetes in 5mins: https://youtu.be/PH-2FfFD2PU
- Docker Kubernetes Course: https://www.udemy.com/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/
