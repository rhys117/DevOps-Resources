# About DevOps
> It provides the structure and narrative to improve any stage of your software development and delivery process.
## Benefits
- Agile, robust & efficient software delivery.
- Reduction in cost associated with fixing problems and deploying new features.
> Automate, Manage, Succeed

#### Without Continuous Delivery
> The old way of working is to build
and deploy the application, and submit it for a test
phase at the end. This results in bug reports arriving
in large batches, late in the project.

#### With Continuous Delivery
> With DevOps we deploy what we call Continuous
Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).
CI is the practice of automatically building and unit
testing an entire application frequently, ideally on
every source code check-in, many times a day if
necessary.

## Continuous Delivery Pipeline
A continuous delivery pipeline should contain all of
the following in an automated or scripted process:
- Build
- Static Code Analysis
- Architectural Analysis
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Functional tests
- Security tests
- Deployment to a production like
environment

This enables releasing software frequently.
> Focus on eliminating
fragile artefacts, creating a repeatable build
process, managing dependencies and creating an
environment of continual improvement.

## Infrastructure as Code
- Use source control for scripts or supporting processes.
> The ideal is to treat systems like code. Develop them in your code editor, run unit and integration tests as part of a continuous integration pipeline, and deploy them.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Auditable:** Easier and cheaper to maintain auditablility on virtualised infrastructure
- **Repeatable:** Scripted virtualisation enables set-up processes to be managed as code.
- **Dependable:** Avoids traditional problems of making auditing and repeating processes difficult by having benefits enabled by source control, collaboration tool and automated testing and deployment.

## Practices
**Incident Command System**
> a method for dealing with major incidents with self-organising
teams who quickly and effectively coordinate efforts
and scale up and down and evolve as the incident
changes in scope, scale, and focus.

**Devs in Loop**
> Developers directly responsible for the service they
create should be involved to achieve a fast feedback loop that helps
improve logging and deployment; and enables
faster resolution of issues. You will find you can
respond much faster not just to bugs, but also to
new features and ensure the right product is being
developed.

**Transparent Reporting**
> Easily-accessible communication during outages to
increase user satisfaction. Produce visible status
pages for each of your services. These should let
users know what's happening, what's being done
about it, and, after the issue is resolved, what steps
you are taking to avoid reoccurrence.

**Blameless Postmortems**
> To engender a culture of blamelessness. If
you want to adopt blameless postmortem practices
for the analysis of major incidents, problems, and IT
service continuity or disaster recovery events, itâ€™s
best to start with a better blameless agenda to
enforce behaviour.

# Verifa Methodology
#### Lean Management
- Principles embrace change.
- Helps ensure efficiently providing product to customers.
> In DevOps the goal is getting feedback
from customers quickly, through incremental
deliveries which feed the cycle of improvements.
Features to pursue should be selected based on
good, robust data.
- Management system for people doing complex work.
- Helps ensure supervision is used to help people do a better job instead of micro-managing activities.

#### People over Process over Tools
> Skills are possessed by
people and not tools, so it is logical to make people
the priority;

#### CD (continuous delivery)
> is the additional practice of deploying every
change to a production-like environment and
performing automated integration and acceptance
testing after it passes its build and unit tests.
