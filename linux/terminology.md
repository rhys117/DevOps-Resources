**Daemon:** is a computer program that runs as a background
process, rather than being under the direct control of an
interactive user. Traditionally, the process names of a daemon
 end with the letter d, for clarification that the process is
 in fact a daemon, and for differentiation between a daemon and
 a normal computer program. For example, syslogd is the daemon
 that implements the system logging facility, and sshd is a daemon
  that serves incoming SSH connections.
