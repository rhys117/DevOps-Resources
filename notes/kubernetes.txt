Discovered Field Name Differences
  Docker | Kubernetes
  Entrypoint = command
  Cmd = args

command/args examples
  If you do not supply command or args for a Container, the defaults defined in the Docker image are used.

  If you supply a command but no args for a Container, only the supplied command is used. The default EntryPoint and the default Cmd defined in the Docker image are ignored.

  If you supply only args for a Container, the default Entrypoint defined in the Docker image is run with the args that you supplied.

  If you supply a command and args, the default Entrypoint and the default Cmd defined in the Docker image are ignored. Your command is run with your args.

Requests & Limits - Control resources such as CPU and memory.
  Requests are what the container is guaranteed to get.
    If a container requests a resource, Kubernetes will only schedule it on a node that can give it that resource.
  Limits, make sure a container never goes above a certain value.
    The container is only allowed to go up to the limit, and then it is restricted.

  Requests and limits are on a per-container basis.
    Each container in the Pod gets its own individual limit and request, but because Pods are always scheduled as a group, you need to add the limits and requests for each container together to get an aggregate value for the Pod.
